Prof. Marco Baiesi

## Week 1

Optimization techniques for Machine Learning:
- Vanilla Gradient Descent (GD);
- Gradient Descent with Momentum (MGD);
- Nesterov accelerated Gradient (NAG);
- RMSProp
- Adams

## Week 2

Deep Neural Networks

Use of DNNs for binary classification in 2D with Keras:
- Behaviour of the DNN training and validation curves as a function of the number of samples used;
- Estimation of the best hyper-parameters using a GridSearchCV algorithm;
- Behaviour of the DNN training and validation curves as a function of the rescaling and the inititial weigths
- Repeating the procedure with a more complex distribution

## Week 3

Convolutional Neural Networks

## Week 2

Deep Neural Networks

Use of DNNs for binary classification in 2D with Keras:
- Behaviour of the DNN training and validation curves as a function of the number of samples used;
- Estimation of the best hyper-parameters using a GridSearchCV algorithm;
- Behaviour of the DNN training and validation curves as a function of the rescaling and the inititial weigths
- Repeating the procedure with a more complex distribution

## Week 3

Convolutional Neural Networks

Use of CNNs for pattern recognition with Keras:
- Behaviour of the CNN training and validation curves as a function of the parameters such as the amplitude A;
- Behaviour of the curves varying the regularization factor and function
- Finding the best model for our task.

## Week 4

XGBoost trees

Use of XGBoost trees for pattern recognition and binary classification:
- Comparison with the results of CNN;
- Feature extraction using 'tsfresh';
- Combination of the feature extraction with a CNN;
- Behaviour of the accuracy as a function of the parameters used
- Study of the best simple XGBoost model keeping a good accuracy.

## Week 5
